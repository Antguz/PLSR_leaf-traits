# Codes to predict leaf traits using PLSR models

These codes are used to predict leaf traits by Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) models. The prediction of leaf traits here is based on spectroscopy techniques using reflectance spectra or continuum wavelet transformation spectra.

The codes are the base of the manuscript *'Prediction of leaf traits of lianas and trees via the integration of wavelet spectra in the visible-near infrared and thermal infrared domains'* by Guzm치n and S치nchez-Azofeifa.

Here you will see to main folders: i) a folder 'data_processing', which contains the scripts for data processing and analysis, and ii) a folder 'figures', which includes the scripts for visualization.

The data used in this manuscript that accompany these codes is available at the Tropi-Dry Dataverse (https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/YBYO7W).
